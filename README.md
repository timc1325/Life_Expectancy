# Life_Expectancy

There has been a growing interest in using life expectancy not only because it is one of the crucial
indicators of the overall health of a population, but it also plays a significant role in the health sector and
the economy of a country. After utilizing the correlation matrix and forward and backward selections, we
were able to select GDP from Consumption, Education, Calories from Plant, Obesity, Depression,
Smoking and Sanitation Levels, and explore how these factors impact life expectancy. With the help of a
generalized linear regression (logistic regression/binary classification)model, we conclude that life
expectancy is positively correlated with GDP from consumption, and Safe Access to Sanitation, while
negatively correlated with depression. The model has an 90% accuracy in testing.
